# Overview


I always like converting currency, and this is an easy way to do so. It pulls current data from an API, updated hourly.

Purpose: I wanted an ad free version of a currency converter that I can use whenever I want!

# How To Run

In order to run this site (the easiest way IMO) download the 'Live Reload' extension on VSCode (by Ritwick Dey), then click the 'Go Live' button on the bottom task bar. It should automatically open your default browser and run the code. **ENSURE** that you have all 3 files open (.html, .css, .js)

# Troubleshooting

If Live Reload does not work, make sure that you have all 3 files open (.html, .css, .js), (close the server and reopen). If that does not work, try downloading the 'Live Preview' extension (by Microsoft). Once installed ensure the HTML file is open, and click the rectangle with a magnifying glass on the top taskbar (that shows all open files), it should be all the way to the right.
